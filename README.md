# FlashTown

FlashTown is a location-based local offers aggregation platform designed to help users discover **real-time offline shop offers** in their nearby towns.

The initial focus is on **Manjeri and Malappuram**, where local shop offers are scattered across Instagram, banners, and word-of-mouth, making them hard to discover online.

---

## Problem Statement

Online platforms like Flipkart and Swiggy centralize offers digitally, but **offline local shops do not have a single discovery platform**.

As a result:
- Users miss nearby offers
- Shops lose high-intent customers
- Offers remain fragmented across social media

---

## Solution Overview

FlashTown aggregates local shop offers and presents them as **SEO-friendly, location-based web pages**, enabling users to discover active offers through simple Google searches like:

> "Manjeri clothing offers"

## Current Stage

This project is being built incrementally with real-world constraints in mind.

**Stage 1:**
- Google Sheets used as a structured data source (MVP)
- Manual + semi-automated data entry
- SEO-first frontend using Next.js

Later stages will migrate to a full database and automation pipeline.

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- Frontend: Next.js
- Data Source (MVP): Google Sheets API
- Backend (Later): Node.js + MongoDB
- Automation (Later): Instagram scraping + offer detection
- Deployment: Vercel
